## Code review

This project was built to be assesed for feedback. The goal were to provide ample psuedo-code and proper indentation to make the project as readable as possible. As a rule, I believe it is important to keep your code readable like you would in a proffesional setting,so that others may double check your work, or be able to make easy changes to the code base.

## AI goal used for this project

<p width="800" align="justify">The goal of this game was to create a fun playable Tic Tac Toe game that can be played on Mobile, Tablet, or computer screens. Just like most games I prefer to play, I wanted the AI to be challenging but not impossible. If you do reasearch, there is a common Minimax AI that has been devolped for Tic-Tac-Toe that is unbeatable, but I wanted to go in a different direction that would be more enjoyable for the person playing the game.</p>

<p>Logically, there are some core rules that can be applied to Tic-Tac-Toe to always win or at least tie every game. I have applied those rules to the algorythm that I have used for those game, but I have wrote in some softspots intentionally. The goal is to be able to try enough different combinations as a player to find the weak spot in the AI's alogorithm, before making a mistake and losing.</p>

<p>Can you beat the AI?</p>
