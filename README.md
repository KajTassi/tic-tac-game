## Code review

This project was built to be scrutinized for feedback. The goals were to provide ample psuedo-code and proper indentation to make the project as readable as possible. This was an independant project, but the common goal in a proffesional setting is to produce readable code. As a rule, I believe it is important to keep your code readable to that others may double check your work,

## AI goal used for this project

<p width="800" align="justify">The goal of this game was to create a fun playable Tic Tac Toe game that can be played on Mobile, Tablet, or computer screens. Just like most games I prefer to play, I wanted the AI to be challenging but not impossible. If you do reasearch, there is a common Minimax AI that has been devolped for Tic-Tac-Toe that is unbeatable, but I wanted to go in a different direction that would be more enjoyable for the person playing the game.</p>
